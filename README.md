# DrunkChess
My variation of chess.
Rules:
  1) Same as in original version but there are 1 King, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops and 2 Horses on each side.
  2) Besides your King, after every commited move your figure change it's value to more important (it's fixed).
                                                              Horse -> Bishop -> Rook -> Horse.
